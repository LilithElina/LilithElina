Hi, I’m @LilithElina.  
This GitHub profile mostly exists for work with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), where I'm an instructor (sometimes teaching git/GitHub) and maintainer of the Data Carpentry [Python Lessons with Ecological Data](https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson). My own projects are hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/LilithElina), though.
